## Abstract

I present a learning framework that models command-line usage as a contextual bandit problem. My system, ACON (Autonomous Command Optimization Network), captures real CLI activity using a Rust logger, streams events into a Python-based bandit agent, and integrates with an interactive `fzf` interface for real-time suggestions. This work demonstrates a novel application of contextual bandits for human productivity optimization.

## 1. Introduction

-   CLI is powerful but has steep learning curve.
-   Existing tools: history, autocomplete, fzf are reactive, not adaptive.

## 2. Motivation

Can we learn *from the user* and *adapt proactively*?

## 3. Contribution:

Bandit-based CLI optimization with real-time interactive feedback.
